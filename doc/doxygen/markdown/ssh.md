\page ssh SSH Connection

# Connect via SSH

Most linux distributions come with an already installed OpenSSH client.  
To be sure, the current version can be checked using `ssh -V`.

Connect to the server:

    ssh -p 9922 cc@88.198.69.104

and run

    cc 

It is also possible to set your name and/or your figurine's color by entering the game with the following command:

    cc [name] [hex code]

If you want to use a name that has whitespaces in it, it has to be enclosed in quotation marks. Also, notice that the
hex code corresponds to a color in hexadecimal code but **does not** need a leading ` #`.

For a quick start some basic colors are listed below:

* <span style="color:#3cb371;">3cb371</span>
* <span style="color:#ffa500;">ffa500</span>
* <span style="color:#6a5acd;">6a5acd</span>
* <span style="color:#00ccff;">00ccff</span>
* <span style="color:#ff33cc;">ff33cc</span>
